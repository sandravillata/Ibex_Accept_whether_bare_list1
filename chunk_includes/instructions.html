Hi. Welcome.  

<p>In this experiment you will read pairs of English sentences, and determine which sentence in each pair sounds <b>the most</b> grammatical to you.
<p>By grammatical, we mean whether you think a native speaker of English could say this sentence in a conversation.
  In other words, do you think it would sound odd for your friends to say this to you, as if they don’t speak English natively?
<p>We are <b>not</b> concerned with whether the sentence would be graded highly by a writing teacher.

<br>Instead, we are interested in <b> which one</b> of the two sentences of the pair is <b>most likely</b> to be said by a native speaker of English in normal daily speech.
Please read each sentence of the pair carefully. But don't think about your judgment too much:  <b>there are no right or wrong answers.</b>
<p> When you are ready to express your judgment, use your <b>mouse</b> to select the sentence that sounds the most grammatical to you. Alternatively, you can also use the number keys on your keyboard to express your judgment:
  1 to select the sentence that appears on the top, or 2 to select the sentence that appears on the bottom.
<p>This is not a memory test or any other trick.  We’re linguists, and we study language. 
<p>There are 27 pairs of sentences for you to judge.
<p>Sometimes you will be asked to provide a short answer to open-ended questions by typing a short answer in a box on the screen.
